Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI), is making waves in the world of private, digital voting. But where did this technology originate? Vitalik Buterin is the mind that thought of MACI. In this post, we’ll dive into his vision for a more secure and private digital voting system.

## Who is Vitalik Buterin?

For those unfamiliar with the name, [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/) is a Russian-Canadian programmer who co-founded Ethereum. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that has been a game-changer in the world of cryptocurrency and beyond. Vitalik’s passion for blockchain technology led him to explore various applications, including digital voting, which eventually culminated in the [proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413) of MACI.

## What Inspired MACI?

Vitalik was deeply concerned with the issues plaguing traditional and digital voting systems, such as fraud, lack of privacy, and potential manipulation. He imagined a system that could handle digital voting with utmost integrity, transparency, and security, ensuring that people’s votes would genuinely make a difference. This led to the birth of Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure or MACI.

## Breaking Down MACI

MACI is a system designed for digital voting that protects against collusion and bribery, while ensuring privacy, authenticity, and that no vote can be censored. How? Through cleverly employing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and something called Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). This combination makes sure that no one, aside from a trusted coordinator who helps tally results, can view the votes. However, absolutely no one, not even the coordinator, can tamper with the results.

## The Importance of Privacy

One of Vitalik’s major concerns was the privacy of voters. In a world where data is often exposed or misused, the anonymity of a voter is of utmost importance in maintaining the integrity of the voting process. MACI ensures that votes remain a secret, and that only a trusted coordinator has the ability to decrypt them.

## A Democratic Revolution

Through MACI, Vitalik sought to revolutionise the democratic process. Imagine a world where communities could make decisions without fear of interference or manipulation. Where funds could be raised and allocated for public goods and services in a fair and transparent way. That’s what MACI is all about.

## Final Thoughts

Vitalik’s vision for MACI was not just a technological advancement, but a stride towards a more just and democratic society. Through blockchain technology, he has shown how innovation can be harnessed for the greater good, by protecting the sanctity of each vote. MACI is a testament to how technology can be a powerful tool in upholding democratic values and ensuring that every voice is heard.
