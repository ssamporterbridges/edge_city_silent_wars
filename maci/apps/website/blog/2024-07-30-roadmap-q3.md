# Q3 Roadmap

Greetings anon,

We‚Äôre excited to share with you what we're building over the next few months. You'll see some of the same themes as our Q2 roadmap as we strive to make [MACI](https://pse.dev/projects/maci) and [MACI-RPGF](https://pse.dev/projects/maci-rpgf) more user-friendly and accessible.

If you haven‚Äôt read the Q2 in review yet to learn what we‚Äôve been up to the last three months you can check that out [here](https://maci.pse.dev/blog/q2-in-review).

## MACI Platform

The team is doubling down efforts to build a comprehensive voting platform with MACI powering it all. Initially called [maci-rpgf](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-rpgf), the project is soon turning into an all-in-one solution for hosting voting, quadratic funding, and rpgf rounds. We plan to work on improving the product with the following high-level initiatives:

- Complete the integration of the PSE's design team‚Äôs new design
- Bootstrap an e2e testing framework to ensure the code is more robust and reliable
- Support quadratic voting
- Support the use of different signup mechanisms
- Move application's data storage from Vercel to IPFS
- Support contributing/voting to multiple rounds on the same deployment

Our efforts will include supporting community organisers who want to fork and operate MACI Platform rounds in production. If you're interested in running a round for your community, [please get in touch](/docs/use-cases/public-goods-funding/quadratic-funding/apply)!

## Coordinator Service

After successfully implementing a proof generation service as part of our effort of reducing the burden on round organisers, we have plans to continue automating all MACI related operations. This includes contract deployment, proof generation and submission, contract details storage, automatic upload of final tally results to IPFS and more.

We see the ‚ÄúCoordinator Service‚Äù as the ultimate automation of MACI‚Äôs main pain-points, and look forward to building a secure and efficient service that will abstract away all the operational burdens of using MACI. For more information on the full feature list that this service will include, please refer to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/issues/1679).

## Explore Account Abstraction

It is clear that mass adoption of blockchain applications will be difficult if users, especially first time users, must pay to interact with dapps. Furthermore, having a crypto wallet installed and configured to work on a specific chain might also not be straightforward for an average user.

To support this thesis, the MACI team will start a collaboration with other PSE teams involved in researching and implementing account abstraction (AA) solutions. We look forward to bringing some proof of concepts (PoC) for MACI Paymasters and more, which will help remove friction when it comes to web3 UX.

## MACI Protocol Improvements

As always, we plan to improve the MACI protocol both in terms of making it cheaper and easier to use, as well as making it more secure.

As part of this effort, we are currently working with the [3327 team](https://3327.io) to integrate their Anonymous Poll Joining grant work into a new MACI version. The effort can be tracked in this [public GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/privacy-scaling-explorations/projects/40/views/20). This work enables unconditional voter privacy, further strengthening user privacy in the protocol. For more details, please refer to this [blog post](https://maci.pse.dev/blog/upcoming-grants-2024).

On top of this, the team will begin the ground work to implement Vitalik‚Äôs latest MACI proposal [Mostly Offchain Happy Path](https://ethresear.ch/t/maci-with-mostly-off-chain-happy-path/19527/) - in a nutshell, the proposal seeks to completely remove transaction costs for users by moving certain operations offchain. For maximum privacy and trustlessness, voters will still be able to go directly on-chain and submit their own signup/vote actions.

## How does that sound?

Questions? Concerns? Ideas? We‚Äôd love to hear from you!

If there is a feature you think we should work on, or an initiative you'd like to collaborate with us on, please let us know! We welcome input from anyone in the community. The best ways to get in touch are to hop in [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sF5CT5rzrR) (`#üó≥Ô∏è-maci` channel), [tag us on X](https://twitter.com/zkmaci), or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/).

Onward and upward üöÄ
