MACI is a privacy-preserving, on-chain voting protocol. It is designed to be used in a variety of applications where stakes are high, and we believe that governance is one of them. At this time, no governance applications have been built on top of MACI, but we are excited to see what the community will build, and kick-start experiments in the following months. Stay tuned.
