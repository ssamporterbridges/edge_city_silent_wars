MACI is a privacy-preserving, on-chain voting protocol. We believe MACI could eventually be used in local elections, where privacy is paramount. At this time, no local elections have been conducted using MACI, but we are excited to continue working on making this a reality, together with our community and their contribution. Stay tuned.
