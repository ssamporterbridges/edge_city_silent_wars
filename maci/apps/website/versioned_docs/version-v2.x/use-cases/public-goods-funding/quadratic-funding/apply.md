## Time commitment

Requirements here vary depending on the structure of the round & team size, but communities should expect to allocate the following amount of hours to implement a QF round.

- **Technical work**
  IE. Configuring wallets, deploying contracts & deploying the website
  Weâ€™d recommend allocating approximately 200 - 250 hours of developer time to prepare for a round. For a dev team with no prior experience with Ethereum development, weâ€™d recommend 300 hours.
- **Operational work**
  Marketing, communications, curating & reviewing project applications & community support. This work takes about 300 hours.

## What to expect after submitting

We try to review all proposals within a week and will reach out to follow up with you.

As part of your application, you will have a series of calls with folks from the Ethereum Foundation to discuss you application and review your proposal. Here, we can brainstorm the QF structure, logistics of the round & help answer any question.

After we land on a round structure, weâ€™ll establish specifics, such as who will receive the grant from your organisation. It takes 4-7 weeks to process the grant proposal, collect all necessary documents, and disburse the grant.
